T23	sentence 2322 2435	Malaria still causes 400,000 deaths per year; most of them are pregnant women and children less than 5 years old.
T24	sentence 2436 2483	Obviously, new drugs are still urgently needed.
T25	sentence 2484 2662	Malaria parasites depend crucially on their intercellular redox balance, so proteins involved in antioxidant defense are superb targets for the development of antimalarial drugs.

T194	sentence 22308 22429	The asymmetric unit of the hexagonal crystal form contains one monomer, thus the dimer AA′ is formed by crystal contacts.
T195	sentence 22430 22576	The four monomers (A, C, B, D) in the asymmetric unit of monoclinic crystals form two types of dimers: Dimer AC (Fig. 6) and Dimer AD (not shown).
T196	sentence 22577 22708	It is worth mentioning that only one (AC) of the three dimers contains cysteine residues (C60, C60′, C115, C115′) at the interface.
T197	sentence 22709 22835	The active site residues (W59, C60, K61), helix α4 residues (112–117), loop residues 120–123 and R89 form the dimer interface.

T205	sentence 23838 23975	This intermolecular disulfide is formed by C73 and C73′, and mutation of one of these cysteines is sufficient to prevent dimer formation.

T208	sentence 24275 24478	In the case of both hTrx and Plrx, dimer formation leads to an inactive redoxin because the redox-active cysteine is hidden in the dimer interface, so interaction with redox partners would be impossible.

T210	sentence 24560 24642	It is believed that dimer formation may function as part of a regulatory capacity.

T225	sentence 26687 26712	Functional considerations
T226	sentence 26713 26947	It is known that dithiols such as Trx, Grx, and Txn and a few low-molecular substances such as Try, DDT, and TCEP can reduce Plrx, and the best reducing agents so far are Txn from Trypanosoma brucei and Grx from Plasmodium falciparum.
T227	sentence 26948 27090	Until now, no enzymatically catalyzed reduction of Plrx has been identified except for rather unspecific disulfide dithiol exchange reactions.

T230	sentence 27333 27512	Under oxidative challenge, Plrx dimers could form, which might have a redox-regulatory function: The active site of the inactive Plrx dimer is not accessible to reduction anymore.
T231	sentence 27513 27670	This would favor other redox relays in the cell, such as Trx and Grx dependent reactions, which might be more essential for survival under stress conditions.
T232	sentence 27671 27830	Until now, no Plrx-specific reductase has been discovered; therefore, dimer formation is perhaps even a precondition for Plrx to react with its reducing agent.
T233	sentence 27831 27898	Initially, the dimer is dissolved, and then the monomer is reduced.
T234	sentence 27899 28011	Oxidative stress could thus cause dimer formation as a regulatory mechanism for the biological activity of Plrx.
T235	sentence 28012 28201	Overall, the entire Plrx surface is much more positively charged than the surface of Trx or Txn (Fig. 4, Fig. 8), and so Plrx might have additional binding partners than those known so far.
T236	sentence 28204 28215	Conclusions
T237	sentence 28216 28433	Structural analyses confirmed that PfPlrx belongs to the thioredoxin superfamily, despite the highly divergent sequence to other members and the modest results of a search for similar structures using the Dali server.
T238	sentence 28434 28508	Unique to Plrx, is the distinct C-terminal domain, containing two helices.
T239	sentence 28509 28595	The highest relationship in terms from sequence and structural fold is found with Txn.
T240	sentence 28596 28713	We therefore propose a new subgroup within the thioredoxin superfamily with the following common characteristics: 1.)
T241	sentence 28714 28749	They are larger than classical Trx.
T242	sentence 28750 28961	2.) They form a ‘pseudo’ seven-stranded β-sheet, with an N-terminal domain, containing a helix-hairpin motif (α1, β1, β2) connected by a 310 helix to the central domain; the orientation of this small domain (ca.
T243	sentence 28962 29011	50 aa in Plrx) is flexible to the central domain.
T244	sentence 29012 29143	3.) There is a large insertion within the central domain between the β-strand (β4Plrx) and one of the surrounding helices (α4Plrx).
T245	sentence 29144 29251	For Txn, this insertion includes a binding pocket for Try; no corresponding molecule is yet known for Plrx.
T246	sentence 29252 29388	4.) So far, an atypical Trx from Wuchereria bancrofti (4fyu) (and all known tryparedoxins (Lm, Tb, Cf) are members of this new subgroup.
T247	sentence 29389 29532	The members fulfill the typical thioredoxin family functions, and just like Txn, Plrx is able to provide electrons to ribonucleotide reductase.
T248	sentence 29556 29678	The surface of Plrx is mainly neutral or positively charged, in contrast to Trx or Txn with more negatively charged areas.
T249	sentence 29679 29826	Therefore, we expect either different redox partners for Plrx than for Trx or Txn, or the partners have adjusted their surface charges accordingly.
T250	sentence 29827 29940	Moreover, we were able to show that Plrx is able to form dimers, depending on the redox level of the environment.
T251	sentence 29941 30118	We suppose that the dimers are inactive because the interface residues, comprising the redox active cysteine, are presumably necessary for complex formation with redox partners.
T252	sentence 30119 30273	We do not know whether the dimer has a regulative function, but we suppose that the residues located at the dimer interface interact with target proteins.
T253	sentence 30274 30380	Moreover, these interface residues correspond to the interface residues of the h and PfTrxR-Trx complexes.
T254	sentence 30381 30522	In particular, we demonstrated that the dimeric interface residues of Plrx are most likely involved in complex formation with redox partners.
T255	sentence 30523 30681	Notably, five positively charged amino acids contribute to the dimer interface in Plrx and are suitable for interacting with the cell membrane or plasminogen.
T256	sentence 30682 30777	This would demonstrate new putative redox functions in a member of the thioredoxin superfamily.
T257	sentence 30778 30956	However, it would be very interesting to combine site-directed mutagenesis of the active-site cysteines with further biochemical analyses to study dimer formation in more detail.
T258	sentence 30957 31191	Since the surface charge of plasmoredoxin differs largely from other members of the thioredoxin superfamily (LmTxn, hTrx, PfTrx), this initial 3-D structure might serve for designing specific redox modulatory compounds for Plasmodium.
