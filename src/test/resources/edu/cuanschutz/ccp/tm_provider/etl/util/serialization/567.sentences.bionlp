T82	sentence 11227 11312	Studies are needed to determine whether the same is true for saliva in animal models.
T83	sentence 11313 11420	If this was the case, the hantavirus in antibody-free saliva could have a rather high infectious potential.

T85	sentence 11687 11905	So far, little is known regarding the effect of human saliva on hantavirus infectivity, but results of experiments we have performed indicate that human saliva could reduce at least part of the infectivity in vitro (J.

T87	sentence 11931 11937	data).
