T1	sentence 0 69	Quantifying Organismal Complexity using a Population Genetic Approach
T2	sentence 71 81	Background
T3	sentence 82 222	Various definitions of biological complexity have been proposed: the number of genes, cell types, or metabolic processes within an organism.
T4	sentence 223 337	As knowledge of biological systems has increased, it has become apparent that these metrics are often incongruent.
T5	sentence 338 349	Methodology
T6	sentence 350 503	Here we propose an alternative complexity metric based on the number of genetically uncorrelated phenotypic traits contributing to an organism's fitness.
T7	sentence 504 680	This metric, phenotypic complexity, is more objective than previous suggestions, as complexity is measured from a fundamental biological perspective, that of natural selection.
T8	sentence 681 786	We utilize a model linking the equilibrium fitness (drift load) of a population to phenotypic complexity.
T9	sentence 787 1022	We then use results from viral evolution experiments to compare the phenotypic complexities of two viruses, the bacteriophage X174 and vesicular stomatitis virus, and to illustrate the consistency of our approach and its applicability.
T10	sentence 1023 1047	Conclusions/Significance
T11	sentence 1048 1314	Because Darwinian evolution through natural selection is the fundamental element unifying all biological organisms, we propose that our metric of complexity is potentially a more relevant metric than others, based on the count of artificially defined set of objects.
T12	sentence 1315 1327	Introduction
T13	sentence 1328 1430	A persistent question in biology is how organismal complexity changes through the course of evolution.
T14	sentence 1431 1744	Although significant progress has been made in the understanding and quantifying organismal characteristics at many level of organization (DNA, proteins, metabolic networks, cellular organization, organ functions, individual behavior) much confusion remains about how to accurately quantify organismal complexity.
T15	sentence 1745 1868	Several intuitive proposals have been made that take into account simple metrics such as the number of genes or cell types.
T16	sentence 1869 1940	However, these simple measures quickly lead to conflicting conclusions.
T17	sentence 1941 2180	Here we propose a fundamentally different approach to measuring organismal complexity; as opposed to relying on bottom-up measures such as the number of genes an organism has, we utilize an objective biological approach: natural selection.
T18	sentence 2181 2329	Instead of asking how complex an organism is from our own perspective, we ask: how complex is an organism from the perspective of natural selection?
T19	sentence 2330 2429	Essentially, this is a top-down metric of organismal complexity that we term phenotypic complexity.
T20	sentence 2430 2558	Phenotypic complexity quantifies the number of genetically uncorrelated phenotypic traits contributing to an organism's fitness.
T21	sentence 2559 2678	A phenotypic trait contributes to an organism's fitness only to the extent that natural selection acts upon that trait.
T22	sentence 2679 2914	Thus an organismal phenotype that is no longer under selection (for example during an evolutionary transition from a generalist to specialist lifestyle), although expressed by the organism, contributes nothing to organismal complexity.
T23	sentence 2915 3075	Secondly, if two phenotypes contribute to complexity, they must be genetically separable: some mutations must exist that affect one phenotype but not the other.
T24	sentence 3076 3255	If no such mutations exist, then although we may perceive two phenotypes under selection, these phenotypes contribute only a single trait toward determining phenotypic complexity.
T25	sentence 3256 3383	As an example consider the affinity of an enzyme for a substrate, and the rate at which that substrate is converted to product.
T26	sentence 3384 3692	If there are no mutations that affect one of these traits but not the other, then these two phenotypes are considered one, until the organism gains the genetic complexity to generate variation in one phenotype without affecting the second, for example by evolving functionally separate domains in the enzyme.
T27	sentence 3693 3861	Phenotypic complexity is thus a combined description of how natural selection perceives organismal phenotypes and how phenotypic variation is generated by the organism.
T28	sentence 3862 3934	This concept was first articulated by Orr, and followed later by others.
T29	sentence 3935 4077	Notably, it is similar to physical complexity, which is a measure of the amount of information that an organism encodes about its environment.
T30	sentence 4078 4201	An important aspect of measuring complexity in this manner is that both the organism and the environment affect the metric.
T31	sentence 4202 4345	An organism with many phenotypes, but living in simple environment could thus be just as complex as a simpler organism in the same environment.
T32	sentence 4346 4605	For example, if one organism is capable of metabolizing both lactose and glucose, while second can metabolize only glucose, the first organism will only be designated as more complex when there is a possibility that lactose will be present in the environment.
T33	sentence 4606 4811	Recent population genetic theory has suggested that phenotypic complexity is proportional to the drift load, a quantity that describes how equilibrium mean population fitness declines with population size.
T34	sentence 4812 4871	This can be intuitively understood in the following manner.
T35	sentence 4872 4960	An organism's fitness is a result of how successfully it interacts with the environment.
T36	sentence 4961 5068	As the number of interactions (traits) increases, it becomes difficult to simultaneously maintain each one.
T37	sentence 5069 5176	Very large populations maintain nearly optimal mean population fitness regardless of phenotypic complexity.
T38	sentence 5177 5522	Small populations can maintain high average fitness only when there are a small number of traits (low complexity) each contributing a relatively large amount to fitness; if there are a large number of traits (high complexity), each contributing only a small amount to fitness, then small populations will be incapable of maintaining all of them.
T39	sentence 5523 5708	Thus for complex organisms, there will be a large difference in mean fitness between small and large populations; for simple organisms, this difference in average fitness will be small.
T40	sentence 5709 5816	The phenotypic model used to link drift load to phenotypic complexity was first formalized by R. A. Fisher.
T41	sentence 5817 5957	He envisioned a multidimensional phenotypic space in which the origin of each axis corresponded to the most-fit or optimum phenotypic value.
T42	sentence 5958 6021	As phenotypic values depart from the origin, fitness decreases.
T43	sentence 6022 6183	The manner in which fitness declines is described by a monotonically decreasing function, which may take a variety of shapes, e.g., linear, concave-up, or –down.
T44	sentence 6184 6286	Individuals of equal fitness but different phenotypic values trace out fitness isoclines in the space.
T45	sentence 6287 6461	If an organism has only two phenotypes, the phenotypic space is two-dimensional and the fitness isoclines are a series of circles centered on the origin of the axes (Fig. 1).
T46	sentence 6462 6599	If an organism has n number of phenotypes, phenotypic space is n-dimensional, and each fitness isocline is an n-dimensional hyper-sphere.
T47	sentence 6600 6746	Because of the assumed geometry of the isoclines, this model is referred to as Fisher's Geometric Model (FGM) of phenotypic or adaptive evolution.
T48	sentence 6747 6808	Fisher's geometric model in two-dimensional phenotypic space.
T49	sentence 6809 6930	Fitness varies along two phenotypic axes, with the maximum fitness located, for convenience, at the origin of these axes.
T50	sentence 6931 7069	Any individual in a population (black point) can thus be described by its phenotypic values, which determine the fitness of that organism.
T51	sentence 7070 7268	At any specific fitness, there are a number of other phenotypic combinations that have equivalent fitness; the values of these phenotypic combinations establish the fitness isoclines (black circle).
T52	sentence 7269 7373	From the optimum, fitness declines monotonically according to the structure of the landscape (see text).
T53	sentence 7374 7570	Each mutation (arrow) is drawn from a distribution centered on the phenotypic position of each individual, resulting in offspring with new phenotypic combinations and fitness values (white point).
T54	sentence 7571 7745	A population of individuals can be represented as a collection of points in FGM and the phenotypic values of each point allow ascertainment of the fitness of each individual.
T55	sentence 7746 7862	Individual fitness then determines the probability of each individual surviving and reproducing the next generation.
T56	sentence 7863 7958	Evolution is thus described in FGM by following the collection of points over many generations.
T57	sentence 7959 8117	To generate novel genetic variation, mutations are drawn from an assumed distribution that is centered on the phenotypic position of each individual (Fig. 1).
T58	sentence 8118 8209	By never descending into genotypic space, FGM is analogous to quantitative genetics models.
T59	sentence 8210 8297	Both types of models assume or require only that a component of phenotype is heritable.
T60	sentence 8298 8489	However, whereas quantitative genetic models represent populations by their mean and variance, FGM is an individual-based model in which each individual is evaluated according to its fitness.
T61	sentence 8490 8635	FGM makes a set of theoretical predictions about how adaptation tends to occur, and many of these have been corroborated by experimental results.
T62	sentence 8636 8990	The greater frequency of small-sized beneficial mutations, the L-shaped distribution of mutations fixed throughout evolution, the existence of fitness equilibriums, and the absence of intrinsically beneficial or intrinsically deleterious mutations have all been observed during laboratory evolution, and all conform to the conditions set forth under FGM.
T63	sentence 8991 9083	The model thus appears to offer a reasonable framework for the study of microbial evolution.
T64	sentence 9084 9315	The utility of FGM lies in the fact that it does not require any particular assumptions about the map between phenotype and genotype, and that the specific predictions about how fitness changes during evolution appear to be robust.
T65	sentence 9316 9573	In the present paper, we further refine previous predictions derived from FGM to take into account some fitness functions compatible with experimental data and use these results to estimate the phenotypic complexity of two viruses evolved in the laboratory.
T66	sentence 9574 9591	Model and Results
T67	sentence 9592 9813	The link between drift load and phenotypic complexity under FGM was first investigated by Hartl and Taubes (although Wagner and Gabriel had worked previously on a similar question), and was later refined by Poon and Otto.
T68	sentence 9814 9934	Recent theoretical techniques from statistical physics now allow an exact solution of FGM for several fitness functions.
T69	sentence 9935 10009	Sella and Hirsh found that mean equilibrium fitness 〈f〉 can be written as 
T70	sentence 10010 10220	In which ν = 2⋅Ne−1 in the diploid case and 2⋅Ne−2 in the haploid, and ρ(f), the density function, i.e. the size of fitness f isocline, is dependent on the number of dimensions and of the fitness function used.
T71	sentence 10221 10243	Linear Fitness Decline
T72	sentence 10244 10798	If fitness is assumed to be a linearly decreasing function of the phenotypic distance to the optimum, then we find that the average fitness is given by (Methods, Appendix A):in the diploid case, in which Feq is the equilibrium fitness (drift load) expressed as a fraction of the maximum attainable fitness of the organism, ne is the effective number of dimensions of the phenotypic space (phenotypic complexity; see the below for a more detailed discussion of why we term this the effective number of dimensions), and Ne is the effective population size.
T73	sentence 10799 10896	This confirms the results obtained by Poon and Otto who approximated Feq(ne, Ne) as 2Ne/(2Ne+ne).
T74	sentence 10897 11096	Although earlier studies on FGM model have used such linear fitness functions (for the sake of mathematical simplicity), recent experimental studies do not seem to support the use of such a function.
T75	sentence 11097 11166	Linear fitness functions give rise to dramatic synergistic epistasis.
T76	sentence 11167 11518	For example, a mutation that increases the distance to the optimal phenotype by 0.1 units may decrease fitness by 10% in the optimal genotype (which by definition has a fitness of 1); an analogous mutation will decrease fitness by 50% in an organism with a fitness of 0.2; this mutation will become lethal in any genotype with a fitness less than 0.1.
T77	sentence 11519 11629	Recent experimental work suggests that epistasis between deleterious mutations is either antagonistic or null.
T78	sentence 11630 11775	We therefore decided to use a family of exponential fitness functions with a parameter that allows control over the level and shape of epistasis.
T79	sentence 11776 11808	Exponential-type Fitness Decline
T80	sentence 11809 11936	In an effort to explore fitness functions more compatible with experimental data, we studied the following family of functions.
T81	sentence 11937 12129	f(d) = exp(−(dQ)), in which fitness is an exponentially decaying function of the distance to the optimum to the power of Q. Q is a parameter that modifies the concavity of the fitness decline.
T82	sentence 12130 12257	As organisms move away from the optimum the effect of the mutation tend to have bigger effect if Q>1 and smaller effect if Q<1.
T83	sentence 12258 12324	In such a case the fitness equilibriums are (Methods, Appendix A).
T84	sentence 12326 12381	Thus in the haploid case on which we will focus later: 
T85	sentence 12382 12511	The validity of these results was confirmed by an individual based model of simulation analogous to one used previously (Fig. 2).
T86	sentence 12512 12586	Predicted equilibrium fitness as a function of phenotypic complexity (ne).
T87	sentence 12587 12672	Results are shown for populations of size 100 (black), ten (grey), and three (white).
T88	sentence 12673 12776	An exponential fitness decline in which Q = 1 was used (yielding a fitness function of f(d) = exp(−d)).
T89	sentence 12777 12886	Circles indicate the average fitness reached in the simulation model; curves indicate the analytical results.
T90	sentence 12887 12938	Robustness of Fitness Equilibrium to FGM Hypothesis
T91	sentence 12939 13036	The implementation of FGM requires several assumptions in regards to the biology of the organism.
T92	sentence 13037 13190	The distributions of the mutations and the shape of the fitness function are required, and the geometry of the fitness isoclines needs to be symmetrical.
T93	sentence 13191 13296	However, we show below that the equilibrium drift load is fairly insensitive to these strict assumptions.
T94	sentence 13297 13398	First, as equation (4) suggests, the fitness equilibrium is independent of the mutational properties.
T95	sentence 13399 13599	As long as mutation is assumed to be isotropic, only the convergence time to equilibrium, and not the equilibrium fitness value, is affected by the distribution of mutational effects (data not shown).
T96	sentence 13600 13816	Second, although the results depend on the shape of the fitness function (linear or exponential-type), they are independent of the slope: equilibrium values will be the same if f(d) = exp(−αdQ) (Methods, Appendix B).
T97	sentence 13817 14067	Third, although the canonical FGM assumes circular fitness isoclines, it can be shown that if fitness isoclines are elliptical instead of circular, then the density function is affected, but this cancels out in the calculation of fitness equilibrium.
T98	sentence 14068 14291	This holds for fitness isoclines and also for any fitness function of the form f(X) = exp(−∑αixi Q), where X = (x0, x1, …, xn) is the coordinate of an individual in FGM, and αi are positive parameters (Methods, Appendix B).
T99	sentence 14292 14497	Finally, if the mutation cloud is a Gaussian ellipsoid, it has been shown that an appropriate change of axes result in a space in which fitness isoclines are ellipsoid while the mutation cloud is circular.
T100	sentence 14498 14727	Hence it seems that asymmetry in both the mutational distribution and the fitness isoclines do not affect the equilibrium fitness values, a robustness of the equilibrium fitness confirmed by some simulation data (data not shown).
T101	sentence 14728 14932	The equilibrium drift load seems to be a robust property of FGM that is determined by the number of dimensions of phenotypic space, the population size and the fitness function (especially its curvature).
T102	sentence 14933 15159	An accurate estimate of phenotypic complexity can thus be obtained if it is possible to estimate equilibrium fitness values (drift load) for several population sizes, as well as the amount of curvature in the fitness function.
T103	sentence 15160 15175	Viral Evolution
T104	sentence 15176 15313	We used two sets of evolution experiments in which both fitness equilibrium values and fitness curvature have been investigated (Fig. 3).
T105	sentence 15314 15666	In the first set of experiments we evolved the bacteriophage ΦX174 on a bacterial lawn of its host, Escherichia coli C. We increased the mutation rate of the phage to hasten convergence to fitness equilibrium with the use of hydroxylamine; this resulted in a mean mutation rate of 0.1 per genome per generation through the 450 generations of evolution.
T106	sentence 15667 15815	Population size-dependent fitness equilibriums were observed, confirming that evolution occurred in a manner compatible with the assumptions of FGM.
T107	sentence 15816 15921	From these populations we obtained 21 measures of equilibrium fitness at five different population sizes.
T108	sentence 15922 16104	Every transfer corresponded roughly to five phage generations and effective population size was then approximated to five times the number of plaques transferred (the harmonic mean).
T109	sentence 16106 16203	Equilibrium drift load as a function of population size for vesicular stomatitis virus and ΦX174.
T110	sentence 16205 16259	Each point indicates the mean fitness of a population.
T111	sentence 16260 16336	The VSV populations are shown in dark grey and the ΦX174 are shown in white.
T112	sentence 16337 16395	Some points have been displaced on the x-axis for clarity.
T113	sentence 16396 16584	The VSV populations were transferred at effective population sizes of four, ten, and 60; the ΦX174 populations were transferred at effective population sizes of 15, 50, 150, 500, and 1250.
T114	sentence 16585 16801	The dotted lines specify the maximum likelihood estimate of the fref value (the maximum attainable fitness); the dark dotted line indicates the value for VSV and the lighter dashed line indicates the value for ΦX174.
T115	sentence 16805 17068	To estimate the curvature of the fitness function we performed a mutation accumulation analysis for high and low fitness clones and showed that the distribution of deleterious mutations was similar at both ends of the fitness range spanning a 300-fold difference.
T116	sentence 17069 17143	This suggests that there is very little curvature of the fitness function.
T117	sentence 17144 17274	We used a second set of data from the literature, in which populations were evolved for 20 transfers at different effective sizes.
T118	sentence 17275 17406	Novella et al. evolved four clones of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) using plaque-to-plaque transfers of sizes two, five, and 30.
T119	sentence 17407 17474	They also observed a population size-dependant fitness convergence.
T120	sentence 17475 17761	Although the time for convergence was relatively short (40 viral generations), several populations experienced no significant increases or decreases in fitness over all replicates at a given population size, suggesting that those population were at or near an equilibrium fitness value.
T121	sentence 17762 17860	We used the fitness estimates from 24 populations evolved at population sizes of two, five and 30.
T122	sentence 17861 18027	Every transfer corresponded to roughly two viral generations and effective population size was thus approximated as two times the number of viral plaques transferred.
T123	sentence 18028 18174	Additionally, an impressive set of data using site directed mutagenesis in VSV suggests that the concavity of fitness function is slightly upward.
T124	sentence 18175 18319	However, in further analyses we estimate Q as 1 for both the phage and the virus, as no clear departure from 1 has been observed in either case.
T125	sentence 18320 18372	Maximum Likelihood Estimate of Phenotypic Complexity
T126	sentence 18373 18479	We wish to use the previous mathematical results to estimate phenotypic complexity from experimental data.
T127	sentence 18480 18795	However, there are two unknown parameters in the experimental system that affect the equilibrium drift load in a population: phenotypic complexity and the maximum attainable fitness that can be reached by the viruses in the laboratory environment (this parameter has been scaled to one in the previous derivations).
T128	sentence 18796 19168	Using methods from statistical physics, we can find the distribution of population fitness at equilibrium (shown above), and thus derive a likelihood model that gives the probability of the observed data for each couplet (ne/Q, fref), in which ne is the phenotypic complexity, Q a parameter of the curvature of the fitness surface, and fref the maximum attainable fitness.
T129	sentence 19169 19432	We also take into account the noise in our experimental assessment of fitness values; especially for high fitness populations, noise in the estimates of fitness can alter the estimation of fref, as this parameter is by definition higher than all fitness measures.
T130	sentence 19433 19614	Thus rather than using the probability of the point estimate of fitness, we integrated the probability between plus (f+) and minus (f−) one standard deviation of the point estimate.
T131	sentence 19615 19643	In Appendix C we show that  
T132	sentence 19644 19696	Estimates of Phenotypic Complexity for VSV and ΦX174
T133	sentence 19698 19923	We applied the maximum likelihood estimator to the experimental estimates of population fitness for ΦX174 and VSV, and using a likelihood ratio test we defined 95% confidence intervals (CI), which we list here in parentheses.
T134	sentence 19924 19991	For ΦX174 we found ne/Q = 45 (42−49), and fref = 1.245 (1.23−1.26),
T135	sentence 19992 20061	whereas for VSV we found ne/Q = 10 (8−12) and fref = 1.98 (1.94−2.05)
T136	sentence 20062 20073	( Fig. 3 ).
T137	sentence 20074 20217	In both of these cases, fref is calculated per generation relative to the ancestral virus for ΦX174 and relative to a reference strain for VSV.
T138	sentence 20218 20348	As no strong signature of curvature in the fitness surface has been found for either virus, we assume that Q is approximately one.
T139	sentence 20349 20359	Discussion
T140	sentence 20360 20459	To understand how biological complexity changes during the course of evolution, a metric is needed.
T141	sentence 20460 20607	Previously, measures such as the number of genes, cell types or metabolic processes have been proposed, but they often lead to incongruent results.
T142	sentence 20608 20674	Organisms with more cell types do not necessarily have more genes.
T143	sentence 20675 20771	Here we suggest that a metric unifying biological systems has not been appropriately identified.
T144	sentence 20772 20886	To circumvent this problem, we have developed a metric of biological complexity termed phenotypic complexity (ne).
T145	sentence 20887 21081	We have quantified this metric in the viruses ΦX174 and VSV by utilizing a population genetic model that describes how phenotypic complexity affects the drift load that a population experiences.
T146	sentence 21083 21217	Phenotypic complexity (ne) is a measure of the number of genetically uncorrelated phenotypes that are acted upon by natural selection.
T147	sentence 21218 21423	Because Darwinian evolution through natural selection is the fundamental element unifying all biological organisms, we propose that ne is potentially a more relevant metric than those previously suggested.
T148	sentence 21424 21447	Robustness of the Model
T149	sentence 21448 21627	Using recent theoretical results we have analytically quantified the dependency of the drift load (equilibrium fitness) on the effective population size and phenotypic complexity.
T150	sentence 21628 21751	The linear fitness function that has been employed previously to simplify the mathematical analyses is no longer necessary.
T151	sentence 21752 21907	Such a function makes strong assumptions about the form of the fitness landscape; specifically, mutational effects become very large as fitness is reduced.
T152	sentence 21908 22057	Thus at low fitness most mutations are either lethal or of very large effect, a scenario which is incompatible with what we have previously observed.
T153	sentence 22058 22208	We have therefore studied a more general family of fitness functions of the form f(d) = exp(−(dQ)), and found that Feq(Ne, ne) = (1−(2⋅Ne−1)−1)(ne/Q).
T154	sentence 22209 22430	It appears that this equation remains valid over a much wider range of conditions than those used in the canonical FGM, in which mutations are required to be isotropic and fitness isoclines are symmetric about the origin.
T155	sentence 22431 22573	An interesting feature of this formula is that it does not require a model in which mutations can affect all phenotypic traits simultaneously.
T156	sentence 22574 22666	In the initial formulation of FGM, all phenotypic axes intersect at the origin of each axis.
T157	sentence 22667 22857	This original FGM can be modified slightly such that some phenotypes are grouped into separate phenotypic modules, and within a module, all phenotypes again intersect at each other's origin.
T158	sentence 22858 22989	Any mutation that occurs within a module can affect only other phenotypes within that module, and none that lie outside of it (i.e.
T159	sentence 22990 23085	there is no pleiotropy between modules, an idea similar to previous conceptions of modularity).
T160	sentence 23086 23381	Using the more general description of the equilibrium drift load that we have derived above, a phenotypic landscape a composed of a single module with ne dimensions has the same drift load function as a landscape composed of m independent modules of size ne,i with ∑i ne,i = ne because we have  
T161	sentence 23382 23494	Hence the drift load formula that we have obtained seems to be robust to many of the assumptions underlying FGM.
T162	sentence 23495 23543	Other Attempts to Estimate Phenotypic Complexity
T163	sentence 23544 23636	Recently, another theoretical study developed a framework to estimate phenotypic complexity.
T164	sentence 23637 23739	The model developed used predictions on the distribution of mutational effects to estimate complexity.
T165	sentence 23740 23927	This analysis, which is completely independent from ours, found an interesting correlation between gene number and complexity in a variety of organisms ranging from a virus to C. elegans.
T166	sentence 23928 24195	However, for all the organisms for which enough data existed to perform the analysis, the number of phenotypic dimensions estimated was very small; 0.21 phenotypic dimensions for E. coli, 1.07 in VSV, 1–2 for S. cerevisiae, and 2–3 for D. melanogaster and C. elegans.
T167	sentence 24196 24273	We think that several effects may limit the predictive quality such a method.
T168	sentence 24274 24440	Firstly, mutation accumulation methods and the inherent noise in fitness estimates are very different across species and comparison across species are thus difficult.
T169	sentence 24441 24815	One illustration of this is the large variability in fitness estimates for mutations in a single species using two methods: in VSV earlier estimates (using Bateman-Mukai estimates) predicted a 0.002 mean fitness effect per mutation, while more recent and accurate estimates (which introduced each mutation individually) brought the estimate it to 14% (a 70-fold difference).
T170	sentence 24816 24910	Secondly, neutral mutations are not considered in the model developed by Martin and Lenormand.
T171	sentence 24911 25195	However, part of the mutation produced by transposable elements might affect genes useless in laboratory conditions and will therefore be taken into account in the calculation of mean fitness effects of mutations even if they do not affect any phenotype in the laboratory environment.
T172	sentence 25196 25451	Third, contrary to our model, if phenotypes are organized in different modules (as many data suggest), their model will provide different estimates; in other words, their model requires that all traits can be simultaneously affected by a single mutations.
T173	sentence 25452 25566	All these considerations suggest that a second independent model should be used to estimate phenotypic complexity.
T174	sentence 25567 25680	One of the central FGM hypotheses that we have so far not addressed is the single-peaked nature of the landscape.
T175	sentence 25681 25935	Although FGM contains few assumptions about the nature of the genotypic landscape, the model explicitly requires a phenotypic landscape containing a single peak; without this, then the fitness function, f(d), cannot be described by a decreasing function.
T176	sentence 25936 26147	However, recent experimental evidence over large evolutionary time scales strongly suggests that while the genotypic landscape may contain multiple peaks, the phenotypic landscape is generally much less complex.
T177	sentence 26148 26355	Several experimental studies using microbes have shown that a considerable amount of phenotypic convergence occurs during evolution, even when organisms begin from different starting points in the landscape.
T178	sentence 26356 26447	These phenomena would only be expected if the phenotypic landscape exhibited a single-peak.
T179	sentence 26448 26626	However, the evidence for ruggedness in the genetic landscape is also substantial, especially in experiments that have looked at bacterial evolution of resistance to antibiotics.
T180	sentence 26627 26891	In this case, the fitness relationships between the wild type genotypes, resistant genotypes, compensated resistant genotypes, and sensitive genotypes bearing the compensatory mutation exhibit high levels of epistasis, characteristic of a rugged genetic landscape.
T181	sentence 26892 27325	In other studies in which the cost of resistance was associated with a phenotype, fitness restoration to wild-type level was sometimes observed and, more importantly for our concern, it was associated with a restoration of the phenotypic damage associated with the occurrence of the resistance mutation (transcription efficiency of rifampicin resistant mutants was restored back to the level observed in rifampicin sensitive strain).
T182	sentence 27326 27454	This also suggests the singularity of the phenotypic optimum, although different genetic combinations may underlie this optimum.
T183	sentence 27455 27766	However, as our model is focusing neither on the genetic nature of the adaptive landscape, nor on the rate of adaptation (ruggedness means that several mutations could be needed to restore the effect of one) it should not be too sensitive to the small level ruggedness of the genetic landscape described so far.
T184	sentence 27767 27803	The Concept of Phenotypic Complexity
T185	sentence 27804 27964	As discussed previously, the quantity denoted by ne is the number of genetically uncorrelated phenotypes that are influenced by the action of natural selection.
T186	sentence 27965 28215	The dimensions enumerated by ne are thus genetically orthogonal to each other, and analogous to the axes needed to describe the variation among multiple phenotypes measured on a collection of individuals and mutants in a principal component analysis.
T187	sentence 28216 28412	However, the number of axes enumerated by ne is filtered by natural selection, while in a PCA analysis the number of axes is limited only by the number of independent phenotypes that are measured.
T188	sentence 28413 28748	Because each phenotype is optimized at a value determined by each organism's ecological environment, there is a dependence of phenotypic complexity on the complexity of the ecological niche experienced by each organism; if natural selection does not act on a phenotype, then that phenotype does not contribute to the complexity metric.
T189	sentence 28749 28980	Finally, although the estimates of ne arise from an idealized model of phenotypic evolution; as Orr suggested previously, estimates of phenotypic complexity using FGM can be viewed as “effective” estimates of phenotypic complexity.
T190	sentence 28981 29288	This concept is analogous to the concept in population genetics of effective population size, Ne, in which two populations with different numbers of individuals and different sex ratios might have the same effective population size and therefore respond similarly to the different population genetic forces.
T191	sentence 29289 29478	Thus two organisms, although they may differ in both the underlying genetic mechanisms and in the complexity of the environment in which they live, may have similar phenotypic complexities.
T192	sentence 29479 29826	The utility of the concept lies not in the implications it makes about specific phenotypes or genetic details, but in that it enables a general quantification of how an organism is affected by natural selection (the complexity with which natural selection acts), and furthermore, how this action affects the evolutionary dynamics of that organism.
T193	sentence 29827 29867	Viral Estimates of Phenotypic Complexity
T194	sentence 29868 30123	Unsurprisingly, our estimates of phenotypic complexity are orders of magnitude smaller than either the number of nucleotides or even the number of amino acids encoded by the genomes of these organisms (5386 bp and 11,161bp in ΦX174 and VSV, respectively).
T195	sentence 30124 30199	This agrees with the concept of phenotypic complexity that we have defined.
T196	sentence 30200 30448	Although mutations that occur at one nucleotide or amino acid do not affect those at another (i.e. they are genetically separable phenotypes), it is clearly unlikely that each nucleotide or amino acid is independently acted up by natural selection.
T197	sentence 30449 30588	Secondly, each estimate of complexity is greater than the number of genes encoded by each virus (11 and 5 for ΦX174 and VSV, respectively).
T198	sentence 30589 30754	The presence of multiple functional domains within a single protein is consistent with an estimate of complexity that is greater than the number of encoded proteins.
T199	sentence 30757 31005	Although we have only two estimates, we can briefly consider them from a comparative standpoint: although the genome size of ΦX174 is half of VSV, our estimate of phenotypic complexity quantifies ΦX174 as being approximately four-fold more complex.
T200	sentence 31006 31094	It is notable, then, that ΦX174 contains approximately twice the number of genes as VSV.
T201	sentence 31095 31181	Additionally, the lifestyle of ΦX174 is arguably much more elaborate than that of VSV.
T202	sentence 31182 31326	ΦX174 interacts with several host factors in order to perform transcription and replication; 13 host factors are required for replication alone.
T203	sentence 31327 31461	This can be contrasted with VSV, in which transcription and replication are similar processes, both performed by the viral polymerase.
T204	sentence 31462 31564	Few host factors (and thus few interactions) are necessary at all during the entire life cycle of VSV.
T205	sentence 31570 31809	These estimates suggest that, for very simple organisms such as viruses, phenotypic complexity correlates well with the number of genes in an organism, and more specifically, with the number of interactions characteristic of that organism.
T206	sentence 31810 31940	This observation supports the idea that phenotypic complexity depends on the interactions between an organism and its environment.
T207	sentence 31941 32102	Genome size in itself seems to be a poor correlate of phenotypic complexity, a notable result in consideration of the very small genome sizes of these organisms.
T208	sentence 32103 32252	Whether such correlations or absence of correlation with gene number or genome length would hold for more complex organisms remains an open question.
T209	sentence 32253 32410	Nevertheless, by studying very simple organisms, we have shown that the use of drift load could be used to estimate complexity in a novel and consistent way.
T210	sentence 32411 32559	We now propose that such a method could be helpful to identify and quantify the strongest determinants of biological complexity of higher organisms.
T211	sentence 32560 32711	Although the theory presented here appears to be quite robust, it is too early to conclude that it is an accurate reflection of the underlying biology.
T212	sentence 32712 32819	To be studied in an FGM framework, organisms need to present at least one phenotypic property to selection.
T213	sentence 32820 32970	Additionally, populations, even those of very small size, should evolve towards a fitness equilibrium that is explicitly dependent on population size.
T214	sentence 32971 33058	We found data in the literature consistent with this expectation for one organism, VSV.
T215	sentence 33059 33190	We now provide further support for population size-dependent fitness equilibria by evolving populations of the bacteriophage ΦX174.
T216	sentence 33191 33300	Together, these two data sets suggest that evolutionary analyses using an FGM framework are a valid approach.
T217	sentence 33301 33567	Moreover, the use of very simple organisms such as viruses is useful for gaining insight into metrics of complexity, as for such simple organisms, gene number is likely to be a very good correlate of organismal complexity, and this should be reflected by the metric.
T218	sentence 33568 33690	Although our observations are currently limited to two viral species, it is clear that from both a qualitative level (i.e.
T219	sentence 33691 33872	population size-dependent fitness equilibria), and a quantitative level (that the number of phenotypic dimensions are reasonable) that the predictions from FGM theory are borne out.
T220	sentence 33873 34010	An assessment of drift load and phenotypic complexity in a greater number of organisms is needed before further conclusions can be drawn.
T221	sentence 34012 34023	Conclusions
T222	sentence 34024 34104	Here we have presented a top-down approach to quantifying biological complexity.
T223	sentence 34105 34269	This can be contrasted with previously proposed metrics of complexity, which have relied on physically measurable quantities of the organism (bottom-up approaches).
T224	sentence 34270 34337	Two important conceptual differences separate these two approaches.
T225	sentence 34338 34442	Most importantly, phenotypic complexity is dependent on both the organism and the environmental context.
T226	sentence 34443 34590	An organism is not complex because it has many measurable phenotypes; it is complex because it has many phenotypes on which natural selection acts.
T227	sentence 34591 34688	Secondly, phenotypic complexity does not rely on artificially constructed concepts such as genes.
T228	sentence 34689 34920	As an example, if two genes are deemed to be of equal complexity because they are functionally equivalent, such a measure necessarily ignores the subtle ways in which each may be regulated, or spliced, or expressed within the cell.
T229	sentence 34921 35038	Quantifying such multiple layers of complexity is difficult if the metric relies on physically measurable quantities.
T230	sentence 35039 35108	However, phenotypic complexity remains an inherently abstract metric.
T231	sentence 35109 35213	It cannot aid in identifying the specific characteristics contributing to the complexity of an organism.
T232	sentence 35214 35393	Instead, it addresses the complexity with which natural selection views an organism, and the complexity with which an organism is capable of generating novel phenotypic variation.
T233	sentence 35394 35632	For this reason, testing how phenotypic complexity compares to more traditional metrics of complexity (for example, the numbers of genes, protein interactions, or cellular pathways) may provide significant insight into biological systems.
T234	sentence 35633 35877	Finally, phenotypic complexity (and the resulting equilibrium drift load) affords a unique opportunity to contrast the action of natural selection between different organisms or different environments in a very general and unconstrained manner.
T235	sentence 35878 35885	Methods
T236	sentence 35886 35901	Viral Evolution
T237	sentence 35902 35980	The details of experimental evolution of ΦX174 have been described previously.
T238	sentence 35981 36071	Briefly, phage were mutagenized in 250 mM hydroxylamine, 1mM EDTA at 37°C for 140 minutes.
T239	sentence 36072 36254	Mutagenic treatment was stopped by 100 to 1000-fold dilution into fresh media, after which they were plated on LC agar plates containing a bacterial lawn and grown overnight at 32°C.
T240	sentence 36255 36405	From these plates, a number of plaques equal to the bottleneck size were randomly selected and diluted into culture tubes containing 3 ml of 1mM EDTA.
T241	sentence 36406 36506	These tubes were vortexed and centrifuged, after which 0.5 ml was removed to a fresh eppendorf tube.
T242	sentence 36507 36593	Chloroform was added, the tubes were vortexed and centrifuged, and 0.3 ml was removed.
T243	sentence 36594 36643	This stock was then used for further mutagenesis.
T244	sentence 36644 36690	Appendix A: Derivation of Fitness Equilibriums
T245	sentence 36691 36877	Sella and Hirsh showed that mean equilibrium fitness could be writtenin which ν = 2Ne−1 in the diploid case and 2Ne−2 in the haploid, and ρ(f) is the density function of fitness value f.
T246	sentence 36878 37097	In an n-dimensional space, the density ρ(f) df is derived from the hyper-sphere surface of radius x, with f = f(x), f(x) being the fitness function describing the dependency of fitness on the distance to the optimum, x.
T247	sentence 37098 37233	The surface of the hyper-sphere of radius x is Ω(n)x (n−1), where Ω(n) is the unit radius hyper-sphere surface, Ω(n) = 2⋅π(n/2)/Γ(n/2).
T248	sentence 37234 37277	We have therefore ρ(f)df = Ω(n) x (n−1) dx 
T249	sentence 37278 37361	If fitness is defined as f(x) = 1−x, then Ω(n) x (n−1) dx = −Ω(n) (1−f)n −1 df and 
T250	sentence 37362 37418	If fitness is defined as: f(x) = exp(−x Q) we have and  
T251	sentence 37419 37475	This expression is independent of mutational properties.

T255	sentence 37599 37628	Ellipsoidal fitness isoclines
T256	sentence 37629 37784	Let us assume that f = exp(−R Q) where R is defined by in which x = (x 1,x 2,…,x n) is the position in the n-dimensional space and αi are positive numbers.
T257	sentence 37785 37846	We then have ellipsoidal fitness isoclines of semi-axes R/αi.
T258	sentence 37847 38011	As the volume of such an ellipsoid is with  being the Euler Gamma function and the density ρ(f) df = dV(f) df is similar to the one found in the previous case with 
T259	sentence 38012 38107	we therefore find the same value of 〈f〉, as the constant cancels out in the ratio of integrals.
T260	sentence 38108 38150	More generally, if fitness is defined as  
T261	sentence 38151 38270	We can show through recursions that this defines volumes and that once again the equilibrium fitness remains unchanged.
