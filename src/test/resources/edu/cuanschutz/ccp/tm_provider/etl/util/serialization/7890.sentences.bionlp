T79	sentence 10916 11025	They showed that 50% of FIPV 79-1146 infected monocytes do not express viral antigens on the plasma membrane.
T80	sentence 11026 11303	The absence of viral antigens on the surface of FIPV positive cells isolated from FIP cats that seem to be capable of expressing viral antigens, can be due to the fact that virus-specific antibodies bind to the antigens and as a consequence the viral antigens are internalized.
T81	sentence 11304 11398	Another possibility is antibody-induced capping of viral antigens and extrusion from the cell.
T82	sentence 11399 11600	Since the antibody-induced internalization has been described in in vitro infected monocytes that do show surface expressed viral antigens, it most likely occurs also in vivo (Dewerchin et al., 2006) .
T83	sentence 11601 11806	The fact that viral antigens could not be demonstrated with the used staining is not the result of antibodies present in the cat that already bound to these antigens and hinder binding of other antibodies.

T89	sentence 12429 12550	On all FIPV positive cells MHC I was present, showing that no internalization or retention of the MHC I molecules occurs.

T92	sentence 12831 12874	In exudates, this observation was not made.
T93	sentence 12875 12952	The cause of this difference between pyogranulomas and exudates is not clear.
T94	sentence 12953 13063	The increased cell death may be due to infection or to the response of the immune system on the infected cell.
T95	sentence 13064 13183	Since no viral antigens are present on the plasma membrane, it can be stated that antibody-mediated lysis is inhibited.
T96	sentence 13184 13359	The expression of MHC I is not inhibited in infected cells, indicating that the cellular immunity may still be able to lyse the infected cell, if viral peptides are presented.
T97	sentence 13360 13526	It is generally accepted that a strong cellular immunity enables the cat to overcome infection (Pedersen and Black, 1983; Hayashi et al., 1982; Weiss and Cox, 1989) .
T98	sentence 13527 13787	However, it has also been postulated that, during a chronic FIPV infection, the cell-mediated lysis is inhibited due to apoptosis and T-cell depletion caused by soluble mediators released during infection (Haagmans et al., 1996; de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005) .
T99	sentence 13788 13950	Taking into account all these observations, it becomes clear that the outcome of a FIPV infection is a complicated interaction of the immune system and the virus.
T100	sentence 13951 14098	One thing is sure, the humoral immune response is not able to protect the cat against progression of viral replication and consequently of disease.
T101	sentence 14099 14195	The precise role of the cellular immune response in protection needs to be further investigated.
T102	sentence 14196 14380	In conclusion, it can be stated that cytoplasmic FIPV-infected cells do not show surface expressed viral antigens in vivo which may make them invisible for the humoral immune response.
T103	sentence 14381 14450	In contrast, MHC I molecules are abundantly present on their surface.
T104	sentence 14451 14618	Surface expression of the monocyte marker (A); absence of surface expression of viral proteins (B); surface expression of MHC I (C) on cytoplasmic FIPV positive cells.
