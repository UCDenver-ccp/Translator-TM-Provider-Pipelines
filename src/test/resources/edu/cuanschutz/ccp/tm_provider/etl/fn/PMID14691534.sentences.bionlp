T1	sentence 0 53	Pten Dose Dictates Cancer Progression in the Prostate
T2	sentence 55 63	Abstract
T3	sentence 65 193	Complete inactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene is extremely common in advanced cancer, including prostate cancer (CaP).
T4	sentence 194 280	However, one PTEN allele is already lost in the vast majority of CaPs at presentation.
T5	sentence 281 483	To determine the consequence of PTEN dose variations on cancer progression, we have generated by homologous recombination a hypomorphic Pten mouse mutant series with decreasing Pten activity: Ptenhy/+ >
T6	sentence 484 597	Pten+/− > Ptenhy/− (mutants in which we have rescued the embryonic lethality due to complete Pten inactivation) >
T7	sentence 598 650	Pten prostate conditional knockout (Ptenpc) mutants.
T8	sentence 651 820	In addition, we have generated and comparatively analyzed two distinct Ptenpc mutants in which Pten is inactivated focally or throughout the entire prostatic epithelium.
T9	sentence 821 966	We find that the extent of Pten inactivation dictate in an exquisite dose-dependent fashion CaP progression, its incidence, latency, and biology.
T10	sentence 967 1053	The dose of Pten affects key downstream targets such as Akt, p27Kip1, mTOR, and FOXO3.
T11	sentence 1054 1229	Our results provide conclusive genetic support for the notion that PTEN is haploinsufficient in tumor suppression and that its dose is a key determinant in cancer progression.
T12	sentence 1231 1243	Introduction
T13	sentence 1245 1416	The PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) tumor suppressor gene is located on chromosome 10q23, a genomic region frequently lost in human cancers.
T14	sentence 1417 1691	Somatic deletions or mutations of this gene have been identified in a large fraction of tumors, frequently in prostate cancer (CaP), placing PTEN among the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor genes in human cancer (Cantley and Neel 1999; Di Cristofano and Pandolfi 2000).
T15	sentence 1693 1968	As dictated by Knudson's “two-hit” hypothesis (Knudson 1971), however, the analysis of cancer samples for mutations in PTEN has been performed searching for biallelic inactivation of the gene, which pointed at complete PTEN inactivation as a late event in cancer progression.
T16	sentence 1969 2097	The consequence of loss or mutation in one PTEN allele in carcinomas in situ or in primary cancers may have been underestimated.
T17	sentence 2098 2430	It could be postulated that if PTEN were to be haploinsufficient for some of its tumor-suppressive functions, loss of one PTEN allele or reduction in its expression may be playing a key role in tumor initiation, while further reduction of its function/expression may favor invasion and possibly tumor metastasis in advanced cancers.
T18	sentence 2432 2609	In agreement with this hypothesis, it has been reported that primary tumors often show loss or alteration of at least one PTEN allele (e.g., 70%–80% of primary CaPs; Gray et al.
T19	sentence 2610 2628	1998; Whang et al.
T20	sentence 2629 2881	1998), while homozygous inactivation of PTEN is generally associated with advanced cancer and metastasis (Cantley and Neel 1999; Di Cristofano and Pandolfi 2000), supporting a possible key role for progressive PTEN functional loss in tumor progression.
T21	sentence 2883 3151	The elucidation of the molecular basis for tumor initiation and progression in most epithelial neoplasms has been hindered by the lack of suitable laboratory and preclinical models that accurately reflect the genetic and histopathological progression of these cancers.
T22	sentence 3152 3284	Furthermore, the outcome of a progressive dose reduction in tumor suppressor function has been rarely assessed in vivo in the mouse.
T23	sentence 3285 3594	Small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology has more recently allowed testing the consequence of knockdown of a tumor suppressor such as p53 in specific cell types such as hemopoietic stem cells, by generating epi-allelic series of hypomorphs created by stable RNA interference (RNAi) transduction (Hemann et al.
T24	sentence 3595 3601	2003).
T25	sentence 3602 3821	In the case of Pten, this analysis is further complicated since complete inactivation of the gene results in early embryonic lethality and aberrant developmental programs (Di Cristofano et al. 1998, 2001a; Suzuki et al.
T26	sentence 3822 3846	1998; Podsypanina et al.
T27	sentence 3847 3853	1999).
T28	sentence 3854 3952	Thus, a further unrestricted reduction of the Pten dose could still result in embryonic lethality.
T29	sentence 3953 4249	On the other hand, the consequence of complete Pten inactivation, even when restricted to a specific organ/tissue, could still affect the developmental program of that organ, while complete somatic loss of Pten in an adult organ would better approximate what is normally observed in human cancer.
T30	sentence 4250 4438	We have addressed these issues for Pten, as we describe in this article, through the generation of (i) hypomorphic mouse mutants and (ii) conditional mutants for complete prostate-specific
T31	sentence 4439 4471	Pten inactivation after puberty.
T32	sentence 4473 4741	We previously reported that Pten heterozygous (Pten+/−) mutants are prone to develop neoplasms of various histological origins, including prostatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PIN) after a long latency ( >14 mo) and at incomplete penetrance (40%) (Di Cristofano et al.
T33	sentence 4742 4749	2001a).
T34	sentence 4750 4804	Pten+/− mutants, however, never develop invasive CaPs.
T35	sentence 4805 4929	Invasive CaPs were, by contrast, observed in compound Pten+/−/p27Kip1+/− or Pten+/−/p27Kip1−/− mutants (Di Cristofano et al.
T36	sentence 4930 4937	2001a).
T37	sentence 4938 5017	These lesions appeared to originate in PIN lesions, which then become invasive.
T38	sentence 5018 5173	However, no metastatic CaP was observed in this model, also in view of early lethality due to the occurrence of concomitant tumors of various histogenesis.
T39	sentence 5174 5403	Analysis of tumors, PIN, and CaP in Pten+/− mice and Pten/p27Kip1 compound mutants strongly suggested that Pten may be haploinsufficient in prostate tumor suppression since Pten protein expression was never lost in these lesions.
T40	sentence 5404 5555	If this was indeed the case, a further reduction in the Pten dose with respect to Pten+/− mutants should impact on tumorigenesis and tumor progression.
T41	sentence 5556 5725	By contrast, in case Pten needed to be completely lost for phenotypic consequences to be manifest, only a complete Pten inactivation would hasten the neoplastic process.
T42	sentence 5727 5948	The discovery that phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) is the main in vivo substrate of PTEN (Maehama and Dixon 1998) placed this phosphatase into a well-defined pathway (reviewed in Vivanco and Sawyers 2002).
T43	sentence 5949 6103	PIP3 levels are very low in quiescent cells, but rapidly increase upon stimulation by growth factors, through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation.
T44	sentence 6104 6195	The role of PTEN is to keep the levels of PIP3 low by dephosphorylation at the D3 position.
T45	sentence 6196 6265	Loss of PTEN function results in increased PIP3 levels and subsequent
T46	sentence 6266 6319	Akt hyperactivation/phosphorylation (Stambolic et al.
T47	sentence 6320 6346	1998; Di Cristofano et al.
T48	sentence 6347 6367	1999; Backman et al.
T49	sentence 6368 6400	2002; Vivanco and Sawyers 2002).
T50	sentence 6401 6620	It may therefore be proposed that a progressive reduction in the Pten dose could simply result in a concomitant progressive dose-dependent increase in Akt activation and its downstream molecular biological consequences.
T51	sentence 6621 6809	Alternatively, Pten expression levels may constitute discrete biochemical thresholds below which qualitative functional changes would occur, contributing to tumor progression and invasion.
T52	sentence 6811 6880	CaP is the most common non-skin malignancy among Western adult males.
T53	sentence 6881 7005	It is estimated that in 2003, approximately 220,900 new cases and 28,900 CaP-related deaths will occur in the United States.
T54	sentence 7006 7184	Approximately 70% of CaP patients will harbor mutation or display loss of at least one allele of PTEN ensuing in the constitutive activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway (Gray et al.
T55	sentence 7185 7203	1998; Whang et al.
T56	sentence 7204 7243	1998; Di Cristofano and Pandolfi 2000).
T57	sentence 7244 7414	As aforementioned, those mutations are in positive correlation with tumor stage and grade, PTEN being completely lost in approximately 40% of metastatic CaPs (Gray et al.
T58	sentence 7415 7433	1998; Whang et al.
T59	sentence 7434 7440	1998).
T60	sentence 7441 7616	We therefore decided to focus on the prostate as an important model system to determine genetically whether and how the dose of Pten dictates tumor initiation and progression.
T61	sentence 7618 7899	We demonstrate in vivo, in a hypomorphic mouse mutant series, that Pten plays a crucial dose-dependent role in CaP tumor suppression and that Pten progressive inactivation leads to both quantitative and qualitative molecular and biological changes towards full-blown tumorigenesis.
T62	sentence 7901 7908	Results
T63	sentence 7910 7956	Generation of a Hypomorphic Pten Mutant Series
T64	sentence 7958 8144	We have previously reported that Pten heterozygous mutants are tumor prone and viable, while complete Pten inactivation results in embryonic lethality (Di Cristofano et al. 1998, 2001a).
T65	sentence 8145 8307	We therefore decided to generate and characterize a mouse mutant in which the dose of Pten would be reduced further below the levels observed in a Pten+/− mutant.
T66	sentence 8308 8544	To this end, we at first engineered by homologous recombination an allele of Pten that would express a wild-type Pten gene at reduced levels, taking advantage of the well-known phenomenon of transcriptional interference (McDevitt et al.
T67	sentence 8545 8564	1997; Morita et al.
T68	sentence 8565 8571	2003).
T69	sentence 8572 8755	We therefore targeted within Pten intron 3 the neomycin (Neo) cassette under the control of the strong CMV promoter (Figure 1A; see also Figure 3A) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.
T70	sentence 8756 8970	Transcription of the Neo cassette in the recombined allele was expected to interfere with the transcription of the Pten gene, in turn resulting in lower expression levels of a wild-type Pten protein by this allele.
T71	sentence 8971 9115	Correctly recombined ES clones were obtained (see Figure 3B; see Materials and Methods) and injected into blastocysts for germline transmission.
T72	sentence 9116 9236	Mutants harboring the Ptenhy allele were obtained from recombined ES cells and were found viable, thriving, and fertile.
T73	sentence 9237 9335	We next intercrossed Ptenhy/+ mice with Pten+/− mice to generate a hypomorphic series (Figure 1B).
T74	sentence 9337 9402	Partial Rescue of Embryonic Lethality in Pten Hypomorphic Mutants
T75	sentence 9404 9561	The further reduction of the Pten dose could indeed result in embryonic lethality; we therefore assessed whether compound Ptenhy/− mice would be born at all.
T76	sentence 9562 9658	In the analyzed cohort (n = 190), viable male and female Ptenhy/− mutants were in fact obtained.
T77	sentence 9659 9740	However, the frequencies among various genotypes did not follow Mendelian ratios.
T78	sentence 9741 9819	Out of the 25% Ptenhy/− mutants expected in these crosses, only 10% were born.
T79	sentence 9820 9934	In particular, approximately 40% of the Ptenhy/− males and 75% of the Ptenhy/− females were lost during gestation.
T80	sentence 9935 10203	This strongly suggested that a further reduction of the Pten dose had occurred in Ptenhy/− mutants and that this reduction still results in embryonic lethality, albeit at incomplete penetrance (the embryonic phenotype of the Ptenhy/− will be described elsewhere; L. C.
T81	sentence 10204 10218	Trotman and P.
T82	sentence 10219 10250	P. Pandolfi, unpublished data).
T83	sentence 10251 10352	Enough viable Ptenhy/− males were obtained, however, and monitored for tumorigenesis in the prostate.
T84	sentence 10353 10602	As predicted, a significant reduction in Pten levels and the consequent increase in Akt activation (phospho-Akt/Akt ratio) were observed in organs and primary cells from Ptenhy/− mutants when compared to Pten+/−, Ptenhy/+, and wild-type littermates.
T85	sentence 10603 10791	In particular, we analyzed mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and prostates of various genotypes (Figure 1C; Figure 2A and 2B; data not shown).
T86	sentence 10792 10951	Semiquantitative RT–PCR analysis confirmed the reduction of Pten mRNA expression in Ptenhy/− MEFs when compared to Pten+/− and wild-type cells (see Figure 1D).
T87	sentence 10953 11018	Massive Prostate Hyperplasia and Invasive CaP in Ptenhy/− Mutants
T88	sentence 11020 11180	The levels of Pten were indeed further reduced in the prostates from Ptenhy/− mutants when compared to wild-type, Ptenhy/+, and Pten+/− mice (Figure 2A and 2B).
T89	sentence 11181 11254	Conversely, Akt activation was increased in Ptenhy/− mutants (Figure 2B).
T90	sentence 11255 11425	On this premise, we therefore studied prostate tumorigenesis in Ptenhy/+ (n = 26), Pten+/− (n = 24 in this study plus n = 18, as previously reported; Di Cristofano et al.
T91	sentence 11426 11487	2001a), and Ptenhy/− (n = 14) mutants on a comparative basis.
T92	sentence 11488 12086	Mice were followed throughout their lives according to the following experimental scheme: (i) all cohorts were subjected to serial monthly (in selected cases, biweekly) nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (see Materials and Methods) for detection of morphological changes in the size and shape of the prostate; (ii) mice were sacrificed at or prior to tumor detection for postmortem pathological analysis or when manifest sign of distress were observed (owing to tumor codevelopment; Ptenhy/− mutants, as Pten+/− mice, in fact, developed tumors of multiple histologic origins; data not shown).
T93	sentence 12087 12172	Striking differences were observed in the prostates of these three cohorts over time.
T94	sentence 12173 12295	The prostates of Pten+/+ and Pten+/− mice were never found enlarged by MRI analysis at any age (Figure 2C; see Figure 5D).
T95	sentence 12296 12537	Pten+/− mutants developed moderate/low-grade PINs at incomplete penetrance (35%–40% approximately, after a long latency of >12 mo) that were only detected by serial postmortem analysis, as previously reported (Figure 2F; Di Cristofano et al.
T96	sentence 12538 12545	2001a).
T97	sentence 12546 12646	Strikingly, however, MRI analysis immediately revealed a profound difference in the Ptenhy/− cohort.
T98	sentence 12647 12773	The prostates of these mice were found markedly enlarged, and prostate growths were detected starting at 3 mo (see Figure 5D).
T99	sentence 12774 12867	By 6–8 mo, these growths typically surpassed the size of seminal vesicles (Figure 2C and 2D).
T100	sentence 12868 13015	Interestingly, prostate enlargements were not accompanied by an overall increase in total body weight or size in Ptenhy/− mutants (data not shown).
T101	sentence 13016 13137	Postmortem pathological analysis of such mutants confirmed the marked epithelial hyperplasia of the prostate (Figure 2F).
T102	sentence 13138 13255	All lobes were found to be hypercellular, with prominent macroscopic enlargements of anterior and dorsolateral lobes.
T103	sentence 13256 13474	Microscopically, the regular and round prostatic glands observed in wild-type mice were replaced by large, irregular, and complex glands that contained multiple intraluminal papillary projections already at age 2–3 mo.
T104	sentence 13475 13773	Furthermore, many cells had sizeable nuclei, clumped chromatin, and prominent nucleoli, forming foci of epithelial dysplasia.The phenotype observed in the Ptenhy/− mice was characterized by a wide spectrum of levels of cellular differentiation, which was not typically observed in the Pten+/− mice.
T105	sentence 13774 13863	As we previously reported in Pten+/− and Pten+/−/p27Kip1−/− mutants (Di Cristofano et al.
T106	sentence 13864 14079	2001a), Pten protein expression was also still retained in the hyperplastic prostates from Ptenhy/− mutants, and Southern blot analysis confirmed retention of the hypomorphic Pten allele (Figure 2E; data not shown).
T107	sentence 14080 14341	Importantly, approximately 25% of the Ptenhy/− mice analyzed at more than 6 mo of age showed histological signs of local invasion, with tumor cells disrupting the basement membrane of the gland and growing into the surrounding stroma (Figure 2F; see Figure 5E).
T108	sentence 14342 14674	Thus, strikingly, a further reduction in the Pten dose as observed in Ptenhy/− mutants when compared with Pten+/− mutants does lead to massive prostate hyperplasia at complete penetrance and accelerates tumor progression from high-grade PIN (grade 3–4 tumor as per the CaP grading system for genetically engineered mice; Park et al.
T109	sentence 14675 14725	2001) to locally invasive CaP in this mouse model.
T110	sentence 14727 14783	Generation of Conditional Prostate-Specific Pten Mutants
T111	sentence 14785 14898	We next determined whether complete Pten inactivation in the prostate would further affect CaP tumor progression.
T112	sentence 14899 15032	To this end, we generated mouse mutants in which Pten exons 4 and 5 are flanked by loxP sites (Figure 3A; see Materials and Methods).
T113	sentence 15033 15036	The
T114	sentence 15037 15154	Neo cassette was excised from the locus in vivo by intercrossing Ptenhy/+ with EIIA-Cre transgenic mice (Lakso et al.
T115	sentence 15155 15161	1996).
T116	sentence 15162 15465	In these mice, the Cre recombinase is expressed transiently, early in embryogenesis, allowing the production of a mosaic progeny that harbors in the germline Pten alleles in three different configurations: targeted unmodified (still retaining the Neo cassette), Pten floxed, or Pten deleted (Figure 3A).
T117	sentence 15466 15601	Breeding of these mosaic mutants allowed us to generate mice heterozygous for the Pten floxed allele (PtenloxP mutants; see Figure 3B).
T118	sentence 15603 15777	As expected, PtenloxP mice were born following Mendelian frequencies, viable and fertile, and were utilized for the conditional inactivation of the Pten gene in the prostate.
T119	sentence 15778 15985	To this end, we made use of two different Cre transgenic lines, PB-Cre and PB-Cre4, in which the Cre gene is under the control of two distinct versions of the rat Probasin (PB) gene promoter (Maddison et al.
T120	sentence 15986 16001	2000; Wu et al.
T121	sentence 16002 16008	2001).
T122	sentence 16009 16127	The PB gene is expressed in the prostatic epithelium postpuberty since the gene is androgen responsive (Matusik et al.
T123	sentence 16128 16134	1986).
T124	sentence 16135 16256	Hence, using both PB-Cre transgenic lines, excision of the Pten gene would occur in the prostatic epithelium postpuberty.
T125	sentence 16257 16397	This is of relevance because it avoids any possible developmental effect due to complete inactivation of Pten during prostate organogenesis.
T126	sentence 16398 16487	The main difference in the two lines essentially resides in the strength of the promoter.
T127	sentence 16488 16507	In the PB-Cre4 line
T128	sentence 16508 16518	(Wu et al.
T129	sentence 16519 16671	2001), the Cre gene is driven by a composite promoter, ARR2 PB, which is a derivative of the rat PB promoter from which the PB-Cre line (Maddison et al.
T130	sentence 16672 16703	2000) was originally generated.
T131	sentence 16704 16833	PB-Cre4 mice express Cre at high levels and at high penetrance, while PB-Cre mice express Cre at lower levels and in fewer cells.
T132	sentence 16834 16982	This could in turn result in a more focal or more diffuse inactivation on Pten in the prostatic epithelium, as we could indeed document (Figure 4A).
T133	sentence 16983 17225	Also of note, PB-Cre and PB-Cre4 mice were crossed with PtenloxP mutants in order to generate PB-Cre/PtenloxP/loxP (hereafter referred to as Ptenpc1 mutants) or PB-Cre4/PtenloxP/loxP (hereafter referred to as Ptenpc2 mutants) (see Figure 3C).
T134	sentence 17227 17286	The Dose of Pten Dictates Tumor Progression in the Prostate
T135	sentence 17288 17402	We next studied the impact of complete Pten inactivation on prostate tumorigenesis in Ptenpc1 and Ptenpc2 mutants.
T136	sentence 17403 17581	Mice were followed over time exactly as described for the Pten hypomorphic series by serial MRI and pathological analysis over a period of approximately 18 mo (Figure 5D and 5E).
T137	sentence 17582 17751	Strikingly, we observed a dramatic difference in Ptenpc1/2 mutants when compared to Ptenhy/− mutants, but also, importantly, when comparing Ptenpc1 with Ptenpc2 mutants.
T138	sentence 17752 17979	MRI and macroscopic postmortem analysis of the prostate revealed a rapid massive enlargement of all the prostatic lobes already manifested from 2–3 mo of age in Ptenpc2 mutants at complete penetrance (see Figure 4B; Figure 5D).
T139	sentence 17980 18123	In Ptenpc1 mutants, the enlargement was less pronounced at early stages and undetectable by MRI, but still apparent (see Figure 4B; Figure 5D).
T140	sentence 18124 18309	As aforementioned, the pattern of Pten inactivation in the prostatic epithelium was different in Ptenpc1 versus Ptenpc2 mutants (see Figure 4A; Ptenpc1 focal versus Ptenpc2 widespread).
T141	sentence 18310 18511	This difference also correlated with a clear difference in both the morphology and proliferative rates of the prostatic epithelium in these two models (see Figure 4A; see also the following paragraph).
T142	sentence 18512 18636	Thus, Ptenpc2 mutants displayed a much more severe prostate enlargement than did Ptenpc1 mutants (see Figure 4B; Figure 5D).
T143	sentence 18637 18962	Ptenpc1 mice displayed focal areas of epithelial hyperplasia, with enlarged glands formed by relatively regular cells, while Ptenpc2 mice presented disorganized hyperplastic glands in all lobes with signs of cellular dysplasia, containing large, irregular cells, forming at times cryptic glandular formations (see Figure 4A).
T144	sentence 18964 19206	Even more strikingly, however, pathological analysis of prostates from Ptenpc1 and Ptenpc2 mice revealed in both mutants, at complete penetrance, the development of invasive and diffuse CaP after a variable latency (see Figure 4B; Figure 5E).
T145	sentence 19207 19274	Tumors were in both cases made of Pten null cells (data not shown).
T146	sentence 19275 19367	Continuity of local invasive disease with that of intraepithelial lumens was often observed.
T147	sentence 19368 19434	The tumors were composed of rather large, mature epithelial cells.
T148	sentence 19435 19568	Neuroendocrine features, such as cytoplasmic granularity and small round cells, were not seen in the tumors analyzed (see Figure 4B).
T149	sentence 19569 19796	Although the tumors were clearly invasive in both Ptenpc1 and Ptenpc2 mutants with disruption of the basement membrane and clear signs of organ infiltration, once again we observed differences in the CaPs from these two models.
T150	sentence 19797 20116	In many instances, in Ptenpc2 mutants more than one prostate lobe was completely effaced by the infiltrating neoplastic cells, suggesting a multifocal tumor origin, while invasive tumors in Ptenpc1 mutants were often affecting only one lobe at a time and the extent of the infiltration was less diffuse (see Figure 4B).
T151	sentence 20117 20285	In addition, tumors in the Ptenpc1 animals were well-to-moderately differentiated while tumors in the Ptenpc2 mice were in general high-grade, undifferentiated lesions.
T152	sentence 20286 20451	In contrast, Ptenhy/− mutants displayed a spectrum of phenotypes, from well to undifferentiated and occasionally to locally invasive phenotypes, as previously shown.
T153	sentence 20453 20562	Thus, Pten conditional inactivation in the prostate leads to invasive and diffuse CaP at complete penetrance.
T154	sentence 20564 20631	Effects of the Pten Dose on the Biology of the Prostatic Epithelium
T155	sentence 20633 20761	We studied the molecular and biological consequences of Pten dose variations in the prostatic epithelium of our various mutants.
T156	sentence 20762 20859	We included in the analysis age-matched (8-wk-old) Pten+/+, Pten+/−, Ptenhy/−, and Ptenpc2 males.
T157	sentence 20860 21001	The latter mutants were used instead of Ptenpc1 mice in view of the more widespread pattern of Pten inactivation observed in their prostates.
T158	sentence 21003 21106	First, we determined whether reduction in the Pten dose would affect proliferation of epithelial cells.
T159	sentence 21107 21294	Upon Ki-67 staining, we observed a progressive increase in the proliferative rates of prostate epithelial cells, which correlated with the reduction in Pten expression levels (Figure 5A).
T160	sentence 21295 21447	For instance, approximately 10-fold more cells were found in active proliferation in the prostates from Ptenpc2 mutants when compared with Pten+/+ mice.
T161	sentence 21448 21571	Thus, Pten inactivation, in a dose-dependent manner, lends to epithelial cells a dramatic growth advantage in the prostate.
T162	sentence 21572 21826	By contrast, MEFs of all genotypes from the hypomorphic series did not show noticeable differences in their growth rates under standard culture conditions, while showing progressive activation of the Akt signaling pathway (data not shown; see Figure 1C).
T163	sentence 21827 22027	This may reflect an intrinsic differential cell-type sensitivity to Pten inactivation, also in agreement with the fact that Pten hypomorphism does not result in overall increased body size and weight.
T164	sentence 22029 22285	We next assessed whether and how the progressive reduction of the Pten dose would affect the functions of key downstream targets such as Akt, p27Kip1, mTOR, and FOXO3 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot (WB) analysis (see Materials and Methods).
T165	sentence 22286 22523	As aforementioned, we studied the status of Akt phosphorylation, the major known biochemical effect of Pten loss (Vivanco and Sawyers 2002), using an anti-phospho-Akt-specific antibody on cells and extracts from the various Pten mutants.
T166	sentence 22524 22717	Staining of prostates from various genotypes with this antibody increased proportionally to the decrease in Pten levels as confirmed by WB analysis (see Figures 2B, 5B, and 5C; data not shown).
T167	sentence 22718 22966	In addition, IHC analysis revealed a drastically different staining pattern in prostate cells from Ptenpc2 mutants when compared with cells from other genotypes in that phospho-Akt was found to overtly accumulate at the plasma membrane (Figure 5C).
T168	sentence 22967 23148	A similar staining pattern was observed both in Pten null epithelium prior to tumor occurrence and in cells from overt tumors from both Ptenpc1 and Ptenpc2 mutants (data not shown).
T169	sentence 23149 23283	Thus, Akt is progressively activated by a reduction in the Pten dose, which in turn results in its recruitment to the plasma membrane.
T170	sentence 23285 23400	We next studied the effects of Pten inactivation on p27Kip1, FOXO3, and mTOR, known targets of Akt kinase activity.
T171	sentence 23401 23572	Phosphorylation of p27Kip1 and FOXO3 by Akt results in their functional inactivation through multiple mechanisms such as nuclear export, in the case of FOXO (Brunet et al.
T172	sentence 23573 23654	1999), or inhibition of nuclear import and downregulation, in the case of p27Kip1
T173	sentence 23655 23675	(Mamillapalli et al.

T176	sentence 23713 23735	2002; Viglietto et al.
T177	sentence 23736 23742	2002).
T178	sentence 23743 23879	By contrast, Akt activation results in mTOR phosphorylation and increased protein translation and translation initiation (Gingras et al.
T179	sentence 23880 23886	2001).
T180	sentence 23887 24058	We previously reported that the localization or the expression levels of p27Kip1 were not affected in Pten+/− and Pten+/−/p27Kip1−/− compound mutants (Di Cristofano et al.
T181	sentence 24059 24066	2001a).
T182	sentence 24067 24202	By contrast, a progressive downregulation in p27Kip1 staining was observed in Ptenhy/− and Ptenpc2 mutants (Figure 5C; data not shown).
T183	sentence 24203 24315	p27Kip1 was apparently expressed at lower levels, and fewer cells were found to express the protein (Figure 5C).
T184	sentence 24316 24515	We also studied the status of FOXO3 in the various Pten mutants, analyzing both its localization and threonine phosphorylation with a specific anti-phospho-FOXO3 antibody (see Materials and Methods).
T185	sentence 24516 24786	While no noticeable differences were observed in Pten+/− and Ptenhy/− mutants (data not shown), increase in the levels of anti-phospho-FOXO3 cytoplasmic staining were observed in prostate epithelial cells from Ptenpc2 mutants when compared to wild-type mice (Figure 5C).
T186	sentence 24787 24926	Complete Pten inactivation also resulted in an increase in mTOR phosphorylation in the prostatic epithelium of Ptenpc2 mutants (Figure 5C).
T187	sentence 24928 25230	Thus, the progressive reduction of the Pten dose (and the extent of Pten inactivation in Ptenpc1/2 mutants) affects the proliferative rate of the prostatic epithelium and results in molecular changes, which in turn dictates the natural history of these lesions and tumor progression (Figure 5D and 5E).
T188	sentence 25232 25242	Discussion
T189	sentence 25244 25469	Our analysis allows a detailed deconstruction the molecular genetics underlying cancer progression in the prostate and the assessment of the key relevance of Pten and subtle variations in its dose in controlling this process.
T190	sentence 25470 25601	Based on our findings, we can now attribute distinct preneoplastic or malignant pathological entities to distinct molecular states.
T191	sentence 25602 25796	Furthermore, this new knowledge allows the reclassification, on the basis of their true molecular nature, of pathological lesions that at a superficial analysis appeared very similar (Figure 6).
T192	sentence 25798 26113	In this supposedly linear and multistep process, which separates two extremely different anatomical and pathological entities, a normal prostatic epithelium from an invasive CaP, there are, in between, a discrete number of anatomically distinct intermediary steps, such as prostate hyperplasia > displasia/low-grade
T193	sentence 26114 26136	PIN > high-grade PIN >
T194	sentence 26137 26173	locally invasive CaP > diffused CaP.
T195	sentence 26174 26261	These entities have been recognized before on the basis of their pathological features.
T196	sentence 26262 26582	The fact that we are now able to correlate these anatomical stages with specific molecular events, such as the level of expression of a single tumor suppressor gene, not only represents an integration of anatomical, descriptive findings with biological data, but also offers the opportunity of therapeutic interventions.
T197	sentence 26584 26814	We show in this study that inactivation of one Pten allele in the mouse may lead to prostate epithelial hyperplasia, as complete inactivation of p27Kip1 in the mouse leads to what resembles human benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH).
T198	sentence 26815 27158	However, these two lesions are very different in nature and outcome: the first, in fact, impacts only on epithelial elements and over time evolves to low-grade PIN, while the second impacts on both epithelial and stroma elements, representing hyperplasia of the whole organ, but does not evolve toward malignancy (Figure 6; Cordon-Cardo et al.
T199	sentence 27159 27185	1998; Di Cristofano et al.
T200	sentence 27186 27193	2001a).
T201	sentence 27194 27467	This obviously does not exclude that loss of p27Kip1 expression when accompanied by additional genetic events (e.g., loss of PTEN) may lead to a completely different outcome, as is also supported by our previous in vivo analysis in the mouse (Figure 6; Di Cristofano et al.
T202	sentence 27468 27475	2001a).
T203	sentence 27477 27713	Moreover, our data demonstrate that a further reduction in the Pten dose, as observed in the Ptenhy/− mutants, accelerates tumor progression dramatically, eventually resulting in high-grade PIN and locally invasive carcinoma (Figure 6).
T204	sentence 27714 27768	This fact has very important therapeutic implications.
T205	sentence 27769 28232	As a large number of CaP patients (more than 80%) display at presentation loss of one PTEN allele, but do retain the other normal PTEN allele, it could be proposed that high-grade PIN or locally invasive prostate carcinomas could be prevented or treated by pharmacologically modulating the expression of the remaining PTEN allele or by antagonizing the downstream consequences of PTEN downregulation or partial inactivation (e.g., PI3K/mTOR activation; Figure 6).
T206	sentence 28234 28554	While the massive prostate hyperplasia/dysplasia observed in the Ptenhy/− mutants is not, as expected, accompanied by complete loss of Pten expression (see Figure 2E), the low penetrance of the invasive CaP in these mutants strongly suggest that additional events have to occur for this pathological transition to occur.
T207	sentence 28555 28714	Nevertheless, it is important to underscore that Pten+/− mice, unlike Ptenhy/− mutants, do not develop invasive CaP, but only low-grade PIN lesions (Figure 6).
T208	sentence 28715 28797	Thus, a further reduction of the Pten dose seems to be essential for this process.
T209	sentence 28798 29407	Several possibilities, not mutually exclusive, could be entertained: (i) a more severe reduction in the Pten dose could facilitate cooperative tumorigenesis by rendering the cells permissive and sensitive to the activation of additional oncogenic pathways; (ii) the massive prostate hyperplasia could facilitate the accumulation of additional genetic hits (including complete Pten loss) by simply expanding the pool of actively dividing cells; (iii) a more severe reduction in the Pten dose could protect cells from apoptotic programs that are normally triggered by the occurrence of damaging genetics events.
T210	sentence 29409 29706	The fact that Ptenhy/− mutants develop massive prostate hyperplasia not accompanied by an overall increase in body weight and size underscores the fact that different tissues and organs are differentially sensitive to Pten dose variations, the prostatic epithelium being one of the most sensitive.
T211	sentence 29707 29854	In agreement with this notion, MEFs from Ptenhy/− mutants do not display proliferative advantage in standard culture condition over wild-type MEFs.
T212	sentence 29855 30069	In this respect, it is also important to remember that, unlike p27Kip1−/− mice, which display hyperplasia of both stromal and parenchymal components in the prostate (as well as an increase in body mass; Fero et al.
T213	sentence 30070 30113	1996; Kiyokawa et al. 1996; Nakayama et al.
T214	sentence 30114 30256	1996), in Ptenhy/− mutants it is specifically the prostatic epithelium that actively proliferates, leading to prostate hyperplasia (Figure 6).
T215	sentence 30257 30533	Interestingly, this does not parallel what is observed in other model systems, such as Drosophila, where dose variations in the expression of Pten or downstream signaling components (e.g., TOR) do result in variations in body size and mass (reviewed in Oldham and Hafen 2003).
T216	sentence 30535 30781	While we and others had previously implicated Pten heterozygous loss in prostate tumorigenesis when in cooperation with additional oncogenic events (such as loss of p27Kip1 or Nkx3.1 or the expression of the large T oncogene; Di Cristofano et al.
T217	sentence 30782 30806	2001a; Kwabi-Addo et al.
T218	sentence 30807 30823	2001; Kim et al.
T219	sentence 30824 30847	2002; Abate-Shen et al.
T220	sentence 30848 31057	2003), we demonstrate in this article that complete inactivation of Pten alone in the prostate has already catastrophic consequences leading to invasive, diffuse, and highly aggressive malignancies (Figure 6).
T221	sentence 31058 31316	Although it cannot be formally excluded that complete Pten loss would still cooperate with additional oncogenic events toward full-blown transformation, this finding underscores once more the exquisite sensitivity of the prostatic epithelium to loss of Pten.
T222	sentence 31317 31458	This information should be factored in when tailoring the treatment of CaP or high-grade PIN lesions that have completely lost PTEN function.
T223	sentence 31459 31547	These lesions may be extremely sensitive to PI3K or mTOR inhibitors, while modulation of
T224	sentence 31548 31624	PTEN expression would not be a therapeutic option in these cases (Figure 6).
T225	sentence 31625 31917	On the basis of these findings, it would seem therefore of paramount importance to routinely assess the status of the PTEN gene and its expression in human CaPs and precancerous lesions as a key biomarker to opt for the most appropriate therapeutic or chemopreventive intervention modalities.
T226	sentence 31918 32118	It remains to be seen whether complete Pten inactivation in the mouse prostate also influences the metastatic potential of these invasive CaPs alone or in combination with additional oncogenic events.
T227	sentence 32119 32363	In this respect, while MRI and postmortem analyses have indeed revealed the presence of lung neoplastic lesions in our conditional Pten mutants, morphological and molecular analyses have so far excluded the metastatic nature of these tumors (M.
T228	sentence 32364 32395	Niki et al., unpublished data).
T229	sentence 32397 32549	The stepwise reduction in the Pten dose results in clear progressively quantitative changes in the prostate epithelial cells prior to tumor development.
T230	sentence 32550 32632	Increased cellular proliferation correlates with increased phosphorylation of Akt.
T231	sentence 32633 32807	In Pten null epithelial cells, both in the preneoplastic stage or in overt CaPs, phospho-Akt is found to accumulate almost exclusively at the plasma membrane (see Figure 5C).
T232	sentence 32808 33019	Whether this represents the extreme consequence of Akt superactivation or rather reflects a genuine qualitative change in Akt biology and function in Pten null prostate epithelial cells remains to be determined.
T233	sentence 33020 33246	It also remains to be resolved whether the reduction in p27Kip1 expression is also associated with its cytoplasmic relocalization, as previously reported in human breast cancer cells suffering AKT hyperactivation (Liang et al.
T234	sentence 33247 33264	2002; Shin et al.
T235	sentence 33265 33287	2002; Viglietto et al.
T236	sentence 33288 33294	2002).
T237	sentence 33295 33472	Taken together, this analysis supports a Pten dose-dependent model with progressive changes at the molecular level, arguing against a Pten threshold model for tumor suppression.
T238	sentence 33474 33611	By contrast, clear qualitative morphological changes were observed in the prostate epithelium when analyzing the Pten hypomorphic series.
T239	sentence 33612 33756	While Pten+/− mice never display massive prostatic enlargement, further reduction to Ptenhy/− levels leads to a sharp increase in prostate mass.
T240	sentence 33757 33847	In addition, Pten+/− mice never develop invasive CaP, whereas Ptenhy/− mice do (Figure 6).
T241	sentence 33848 33952	These data clearly support a threshold model for Pten tumor suppression at the physiopathological level.
T242	sentence 33954 34131	Similarly, qualitative morphological changes are also caused by the number of cells suffering complete Pten inactivation, as observed when comparing Ptenpc1 versus Ptenpc2 mice.
T243	sentence 34132 34287	In Ptenpc2 mice, signs of cellular dysplasia and irregular glandular formations were frequently observed, but they were mostly absent from Ptenpc1 mutants.
T244	sentence 34288 34417	Along the same tenet, profound mass increase was always observed at early timepoints in Ptenpc2 mice, but not in Ptenpc1 mutants.
T245	sentence 34418 34620	This is likely due to the marked difference in the number of Pten null cells present in the parenchyma of these two models at puberty, reflecting the different levels of Creexpression in the two models.
T246	sentence 34621 34774	These observations are also consistent with a threshold model for Pten tumor suppression as a function of the number of Pten null cells in a given organ.
T247	sentence 34776 34943	From a biological standpoint, it will be challenging to determine in the future whether this “field effect” would also play a role in the natural history of human CaP.
T248	sentence 34944 35189	On the one hand, it could be speculated that human CaP likely arises from a single transformed cell and that therefore that the field effects observed in mouse models will not be critical determinants in the natural history of the human disease.
T249	sentence 35190 35550	On the other hand, the multistep nature of the neoplastic process (and hence the genetic heterogeneity of the lesion) and the fact that the tumor will eventually grow to form “fields” of neoplastic cells may suggest that these effects, as well as stromal and parenchymal interactions, are key aspects of the human disease that the mouse model can recapitulate.
T250	sentence 35552 35797	Taken together, our findings demonstrate the key importance of Pten in CaP tumor suppression and the dramatic impact that subtle changes in Pten levels and extent of Pten inactivation may have on tumor initiation and progression in the prostate.
